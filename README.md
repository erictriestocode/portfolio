# Portfolio
Personal Portfolio Repository

Location: deprecatedhope.com

I decided to create a brand new repository for my portfolio as I've learned a lot since the initial assignment I was given. Fresh start, more weirdness.

Technologies used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript

Domain hosting: Google Domains
Site hosting: Github Pages

NOTE: Check your console for some live notes as they appear once the page has loaded.

TODO:
- enable SSL for secure browsing
- correct image animation in CSS
- I guess some Javascript tricks but why tho?
